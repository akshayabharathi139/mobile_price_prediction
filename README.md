# mobile_price_prediction

📱 Mobile Phone Price Range Prediction
A machine learning project to predict the price range of mobile phones based on hardware specifications. This application uses a supervised ML model trained on market data and is deployed using Streamlit for a user-friendly interface.

📌 Objective
To develop a predictive system that classifies a mobile phone into one of four price categories:

0 → Low Cost
1 → Medium Cost
2 → High Cost
3 → Very High Cost
This helps manufacturers and online platforms evaluate how a new mobile might be priced based on its technical features.

🧠 Machine Learning Approach
The model used is:

✅ XGBoost Classifier (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
Optimized for speed and performance
Handles categorical and numerical features well
Supports feature importance visualization
The model is trained on labeled data and saved using joblib for fast loading in a production environment.

🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
Purpose	Stack
Language	Python 3.x
Data Processing	pandas, numpy
Modeling	scikit-learn (RandomForest)
Model Serialization	joblib
Deployment	Streamlit
Visualization	seaborn, matplotlib (optional)
🚀 Streamlit App Features
✅ Predict price range via form-based input
✅ CSV Upload for batch predictions
✅ Visual display of predictions and model confidence
✅ Responsive error handling for invalid inputs
